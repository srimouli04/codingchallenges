# My Algorithms and Data Structures

This site serves as documentation for various algorithms and data structures implementations.


## About

The Trie data structure, also known as a prefix tree, is a tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings. It is commonly used for efficient searching of strings and prefixes.

## Implementation

The repository contains an implementation of the Trie data structure in Python. The implementation provides methods for inserting, searching, and checking prefixes.

### Repository Structure

- `Trie.py`: Contains the implementation of the Trie data structure.
- `solution.md`: Markdown files containing solutions and documentation for the implementation.
